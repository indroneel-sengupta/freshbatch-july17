•Implement one Base class AreaMaster which will have these properties 
ID, Code, Name, Description, AreaType, AreaID

o	Here AreaType is the enum which consists of (Country, State, City and District).
o	Create some collections of List<AreaMaster> AreaCollection inside AreaMaster as static member. So whenever any AreaMaster object is created same time add the object into the collection. 
•	AreaMaster will have multiple derive classes like Country Master, State Master, City Master and District Master.
o	Override the property AreaType  in all the derive classes.
•	Create default constructors as well as Parametrized constructors.
•	Create the methods with name GetAreaMasterByCity, GetAreaMasterByState, GetAreaMasterByCountry
GetAreaMasterByCity(string name)
{
                //refer below example
} 

For example:
ID	Name	Code	Description	AreaType	AreaID
1	India	IND	Anything	Country(1)	
2	Maharashtra	MH	Anything	State(2)	1
3	Pune	PUN	Anything	City(3)	2
4	Pune District	PD	Anything	District(4)	3
					

                So when you input “Pune” in GetAreaMasterByCity(“Pune”) than it should print in console. Below string.
                
Name: Pune,
State: Maharashtra,
Country: India,
Code: PUN,
Description: Anything
                
Similarly implementation for state and countries as well.
